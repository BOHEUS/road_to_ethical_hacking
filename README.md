# Road to Ethical Hacking
Like the title says, this repository is a road (rather roadmap) to ethical hacking, since I wanted to learn something in proper order, but couldn't find one so I started doing it by myself. This repository is open to public because I'm self-learning this but I'm not sure if everything what I do is right. Also, it means that you can use it for your personal work but please, link this repo in credits if you want to use it somewhere. The reason for doing this is image of DevOps roadmap for things you must know to become DevOps. (Link:https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps/devops.png - not this one which I found earlier, but pretty much same order) Of course, I don't know what I want to do in the future, so I'll cover a lot of different topics but in the right order so e.g. I will explain what is a Python and how to use it (or rather how to write in Python) before explaining BeautifulSoup. I'll try to add new chapters at least 3-4 times per week in two languages. Also, I recommend looking for interesting stuff on your own and if you find something interesting, make a pull request and I'll review it. Don't look for materials in Dark Net or Deep Web (unless you know how to move there and how to hide yourself) since most of knowledge can be found in normal Internet. One last thing: you must start and keep learning on your own, otherwise you won't succeed, CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions and CP (Competitive Programming) are some ways to test your skills and knowledge, reddit channel r/hacking and r/hackingtutorials are valid sources for self-learning. I think that's all for now, every update will be mentioned in other file named updates.md. Enjoy!

Some rules before ending:
1. This is ethical hacking, not normal hacking! What does it mean? You use your skills and knowledge for finding vulnerabilities and informing your employer about them. Everything you do is for good purpose, not bad. (In my opinion, normal hacker and ethical hacker aren't different at all, they just use same knowledge for different purposes and ethical hacker is only a "fancy" word, nothing more)
2. Keep everything legal! (or at least don't inform anyone about your actions)
3. If you want to train your skills, do it on your own hardware/devices! (or your friends if they agree, jk)
4. Be nice to others and learn something new every day. (writing new things somewhere is a good idea, that's what I'm actually in this repo)
5. No unrelated stuff. (easy to understand, right? only IT stuff)
6. Have a nice day! :3
